## Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Survival Analysis

**Primary biliary cirrhosis** (pbc) is a chronic liver disease caused by bile buildup in the liver which results in progressive destruction of the small bile ducts leading to liver damage. There are currently no known treatments to cure pbc, however, there are many ways to slow down its progression through treatment, surgery, and support care. Depending on the severity, liver transplants can be considered as potentially life-saving.

### Survival Analysis
Survival analysis is used to analyze data in which time until the event is considered where the response is either event time or survival time. The purpose is to help answer patient questions and determine survival probabilities for individual patients at any time. One of the main goals of survival analysis is to help clinicians diagnose severely diseased patients to help decide the best appropriate treatments available to them to improve their survivability. In the case of pbc, a survival analysis such as this can help guide clinicians to timely select patients in severe need of liver transplants or recommend other types of treatment depending on their severity of the disease at the time.
